## 1. Core Problem We Solve

Small and mid-sized businesses know AI matters but struggle to apply it. They lack trained talent, process clarity, and vision. Off-the-shelf tools feel generic and disconnected from real operations.

### Reasons to Believe

1. We bridge the gap between AI and your business, so you can focus on what you do best.
2. Unlock the power of AI with a team that understands your process inside and out.

## 2. Service Offerings

### Phase 1 - AI Capability & Readiness
Executive education, AI fundamentals, process mapping, opportunity identification, and success metrics. Required before implementation.

### Phase 2 - Custom AI Implementations (SOW-Based)
Outcome-based Statements of Work. Deliverables include implementation, documentation, and handoff. No open-ended delivery.

### Phase 3 - Optional Support
Limited advisory retainers or office hours. Designed to support—not replace—internal teams.
